# XC_FINAL_PROJECT_CSCI2021
Hello! Welcome to a single player adaptation for Among Us!
In order to begin the game. Make sure you have a terminal open in your ide and that you are accesing the proper folder. (It should be /final_project)
Once you have accessed the correct folder and you have your input terminal open, to play the game you should type in "python3 final.py". 
Once the file is accessed, there will be a brief backgorund for the game displayed and then a line at the end that prompts you to enter "Start" in order to start the game. Once "Start" is entered the game will begin.
When there is a user input required there will be options that will be printed that you are able to chose at that time based on your location. You can play until have won the game by succesfully putting the ship back on track to deliver the data to Earth. You can also adventure down the multiple different paths that lead you to come to a different outcomes of action or results


In order to activate the test cases for the 'final.py' the terminal must not be running any files. The line 'user@mimir: ~/csci_100_howard_university_fall_2020/final_project >' should be requesting an input from you at which point you would enter "python3 final.py < test.py" in order to play the game from the Start until the game is won. You could also enter "python3 final.py < funtests.py" in order to test the restrictions set by not having all the required components to complete a task.

TLDR:
Input the activate file: python3 final.py
To start game after activating the file: Start
To win: The player must launch the Impostor and engage the autopilot systems to Earth.
To run the test winning test case: python3 final.py < test.py
To run the alternate test case: python3 final.py < funtests.py
